# colourchanger

This script processes a set of images and replaces a specified background colour with a new colour.

The script will ask you for the following input:
  a. Input folder containing images
  b. Output folder for processed images
  c. Background colour to replace in RGB format (e.g., 0 0 0)
  d. Threshold distance for colour similarity (default: 50)
  e. New color to replace the background colour in RGB format (e.g., 255 255 255)
  f. File extension to process (default: png)
  
I made this because I was extracting diagrams from a scan of a book and the page colour was unsuitable.
